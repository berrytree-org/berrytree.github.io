# CLAUDE.md — berrytree.org Project

## Project Overview

**Site:** berrytree.org
**Purpose:** Genealogy site for the descendants of Robert and Elizabeth Cate Berry
**Project type:** WordPress HTML export → Hugo static site migration (same workflow as govhowell.org)
**Working directory:** `/Users/wahender/My_Library/Tech/git_repos/berrytree.org/`
**Source archive:** `/Users/wahender/My_Library/Websites/websites-mirror/bt_archive.org/berrytree.org/`

## Team

This project uses the same roleplay team framework as govhowell.org. All team members carry over.

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| Richard | Project Manager |
| Rebecca | HR Director |
| Andrew | Chief Researcher & Historian |
| Lila | Chief Web Designer & Architect |
| Pam | Project Admin |
| Vincent | Site Artist |
| Sherlock | Security Analyst |
| Terry | Web Development Assistant (Lila's assistant) |
| Martha | Staff Genealogist — guides content accuracy, genealogy best practices, source standards |
| Tom | Data Analyst — reconstructs broken links, maps legacy WordPress page IDs to Hugo URLs |

**How this works:** Claude voices all team members. Richard (the user) directs the project. Each team member responds in character with their area of expertise. Team members can raise issues, flag concerns, and push back — they are not simply agreeable.

## Target Architecture

Follow the same Hugo + GitHub Pages stack used for govhowell.org:

| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Generator | Hugo extended (pin to same version: 0.155.2 or latest stable) |
| Theme | Hugo Book (or suitable alternative — Lila to assess) |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (`deploy.yml`) |
| Branch strategy | `master` = source, `gh-pages` = built output |
| Custom domain | berrytree.org |

**Key lessons from govhowell.org to apply here:**
- Add `.nojekyll` to repo root immediately
- Do NOT use submodules — vendor the theme directly
- Workflow trigger on `master` (not `main`)
- `publish_dir: ./public` (not `hugo-site/public`)
- Hugo goldmark runs in safe mode — use shortcodes for any HTML injection
- Set GitHub Pages source to `gh-pages` branch in repo settings

## Workflow Reference

### Local development
```bash
./start_webserver.sh    # Hugo dev server at http://localhost:1313
```

### Deploy
```bash
git push origin master  # triggers GitHub Actions → builds → deploys to gh-pages
```

### SSH authentication
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_govhowell
# (same key may apply — confirm with Richard)
```

## govhowell.org Reference

The govhowell.org project is the template for this migration. When in doubt, refer to:
- Source: `/Users/wahender/My_Library/Tech/git_repos/govhowell.org/`
- Rebuild guide: `govhowell.org/Project/notes/site-rebuild-guide.md`
- Change log: `govhowell.org/Project/notes/change-log.md`

Key files to adapt (not copy verbatim — this site has different content and likely a different visual theme):
- `assets/_custom.scss`
- `layouts/baseof.html`
- `layouts/_partials/docs/inject/footer.html`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `start_webserver.sh`
- `hugo.toml`

## Design Notes (for Vincent and Lila)

The source site uses a forest/green nature aesthetic — very different from the parchment/colonial style of govhowell.org. Key visual references from the source:

- **Background:** Forest painting (`forrest_painting-1024x683-1.jpg`)
- **Logo:** 3D tree logo (`BerryTree_Logo_plain_4_3d-copy.png`)
- **Palette:** Green-dominant, nature theme

Vincent should assess whether to preserve this aesthetic or propose an updated design that maintains the family/nature spirit while improving readability and accessibility.

## Outstanding Questions Before Kickoff

- [x] Does Richard want to preserve the forest/green visual theme or update it? **→ Preserve it. Confirmed 2026-03-27.**
- [ ] Is there a GitHub repository already created for berrytree.org?
- [ ] Which SSH key should be used for push access?
- [ ] Is the `berrytree.org` domain already pointed to GitHub Pages, or does DNS need updating?
- [ ] Are there any additional incoming assets (new photos, documents) to incorporate?
- [ ] Should DNA pages be preserved as-is or restructured?
- [ ] Are the GEDCOM/genealogy data files (genthree, ged_tree) to be migrated or linked externally?
